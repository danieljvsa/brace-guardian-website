        <h2>Multiple sclerosis</h2> <br> 
        <p> Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by the immune system "attacking" the
            myelin sheath, which is a protective structure that covers neurons, causing permanent
            destruction or damage to nerves, leading to a problem in communication between the brain and
            the rest of the body. <br> <br>
            The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis change and depend on how many, and
            which nerves have been affected, but generally include muscle weakness, tremor, fatigue, or
            loss of control of movement and the ability to walk or talk, for example.
            Multiple sclerosis is a disease that has no cure, but the available treatments can help
            control symptoms, prevent attacks, or slow their evolution, and should always be indicated by a
            neurologist. <br> <br>
            The exact cause of the appearance of this disease is unknown, but it is known that the
            onset of symptoms is related to immunological changes. There are also some factors that can
            help the development of multiple sclerosis, such as being a woman between the ages of 20 and
            40, having cases in the family as parents or siblings, having autoimmune diseases, or having low
            vitamin D levels. <br> <br>
            The treatment of multiple sclerosis must be done with medications prescribed by the
            doctor to prevent the progression of the disease, to decrease the time and intensity of the crises,
            and to control the symptoms with adequate and prescribed medication. Physical therapy is also
            an important treatment in multiple sclerosis because it allows muscles to be activated,
            controlling weakness in the legs, difficulty walking, or preventing muscle atrophy. Physical
            therapy for multiple sclerosis consists of stretching exercises and muscle strengthening. During
            the treatment process, it is important to have 8/9 hours of rest at night, to take recommended
            physical exercise, to avoid exposure to heat, and to perform practices that help relieve stress,
            among others.
